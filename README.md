# LAC3204
LAC3204 is course offered by NUS, called Chinese for Business & Social Sciences. There are some idioms taught in class and apparently they will be tested. The pdf of the collated list of idioms taught in each lesson will be uploaded after the lesson. However, it might be abit troublesome for one to create flashcards using the pdfï¼Œso I wrote this python script to make the process easier. The Python script extract the text, then create and insert it into a text file in your folder.

The text file content will look like this:
`Sentence containing Idiom
Definition of Idiom
Empty Line
Sentence containing Idiom
Definition of Idiom
.

`
Word of caution: The code works for my semester but it might not work for yours, if the lecturer change the style of the pdf
